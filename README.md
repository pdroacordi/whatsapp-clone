# WhatsApp Clone üí¨

Welcome to the GitHub repository of my WhatsApp Clone. This project is a simplified version of the popular messaging application WhatsApp. It aims to demonstrate the core features of real-time messaging. Please notice that while I write this, the project is still in its MVP and does not count the functionalities I intend to add.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **User Authentication:** Sign up and log in functionality.
- **Real-time Messaging:** Send and receive messages instantly.
- **Group Chats:** Create group chats and add members to them.
- **Profile Picture:** Upload a profile picture of your own and store it in cloud.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies used
This project is built using:
- **Frontend:** React with Redux for efficient state management.
- **Backend:** Java with Spring Boot, providing a robust framework for building the application.
- **Database:** MySQL for relational data storage.
- **File Storage:** Cloudinary for storing and managing media files.
- **Real-time Communication:** Stomp.js over WebSockets for real-time bi-directional communication.
